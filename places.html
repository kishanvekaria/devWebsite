            <p>I visited Hampi, India in January 2019. It's an endless field of boulders as far as the eye can see. The heat was immense, so much that we often woke up at 6am to climb whilst the sun was rising. The blaring heat of the sun forces everyone to have a midday break, which suited me fine! Usually after lunch we'd play cards until about 4pm when it was getting cool enogh to head out again to climb until the sunset. </p>

            <p>I've been lucky enough to viist Austria twice! These pictures are from the first time. Both times I went as part of a mountaineering training course. We learnt how to climb on ice and walk across glaciers safely. We also practised cravasse rescue, which is very handy else you'll find yourself stuck in a hole, literally!</p>

            <p>The food in Sicily is amazing. I love italian food, so maybe i'm a little biased, but definitely worth visiting just for this! But other than that I spent the majority of my time dangling on ropes. </p>
